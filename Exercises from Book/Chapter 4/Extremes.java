/**
*Exercise 4.11 From the book:
* Write an application that finds the minimum and maximum amongst several
* integers and then computes the sum of the two extremes. The user will be prompted to input how
* many values the application should ask the user to input.
*
*pseudocode:
* initiate Scanner
* initiate varibles max = -10 000, min = 10 000, sum, number, howMany
* Ask user how main integers are to be enterd
* 	howMany = user input
* for (int counter = 1; counter <= howMany; counter++)
*	Ask user for next number
*	number = user input
*	if (number > max)
*		number = max
*	if (number < min)
*		number = min
* sum = max + min
* print sum
