Welcome to the course D0017D.  Start date: 2022-01-17

The course is a self-studying course, so there is no scheduling for lectures, but only the deadlines for the submissions. 
You study the module in Canvas and the book by yourself.

Programming is about solving problems. 
The course is therefore built around problem-solving, meaning, you are given a problem and you need to find a solution. 
However, the solution shall be logically structured so that it can be implemented as a working Java program. 
In the course, you will learn to write your code by following common coding practices and code style rules. 
In this way, the code will be easy to read for a third coder. 
The course is structured so that each part (moment) build on the previous one, and the knowledge that you have learned in one part can be used in future assignment, following a progressive improvement. 
The programs that you will write will have an increasing degree of difficulty, with higher demands on a clear program structure, logic, and error handling.

In this course, we use the methodology "Late Objects", which means that we focus on basic concepts for imperative/procedural programming. 
We do not deal with object-oriented programming concepts, which are covered in another course (D0018D Objektorienterad programmering i Java).
