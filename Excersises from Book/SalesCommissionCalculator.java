/**
*Exercise 3.19 From the book:
*A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
*The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a
*salesperson who sells $5,000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5,000, or
*a total of $650. You’ve been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The values of
*these items are shown in Fig. 3.15. Develop a Java application that inputs one salesperson’s items
*sold for last week and calculates and displays that salesperson’s earnings. There’s no limit to the number
*of items that can be sold.
* Figur 3.15:
*	Item 	Value
*	1 		239.99
*	2 		129.75
*	3 		99.95
*	4 		350.89
