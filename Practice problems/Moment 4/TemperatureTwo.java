* Modify the temperature data from previous unit/moment on Logic practice probele, 
* so that all temperature values are stored in an array. 
* The program must partly print out which day the highest and lowest temperature were measured and what temperatures it was,
* and partly print out the number of days when the temperature exceeded the average temperature.
