/**
* From LTU: Task 4.8 - Control termination in the while construction
* 
* 	1.	Try to implement a while loop that prints the love message "love, love everywhere" 
*		10 times partly by updating the index inside the while block, 
*		partly by directly updating with preincrement in the condition statement.  
*	2.	Does it matter if you use preincrement (++ i) or postincrement (i ++) 
*		in the condition? Try changing the way you make the increments 
*		and test run your application again with the new enumeration.
