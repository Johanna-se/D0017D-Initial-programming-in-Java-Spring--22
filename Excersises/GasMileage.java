/**
*Exercise 3,17 From the book:
*Drivers are concerned with the mileage their automobiles get. One driver has
*kept track of several trips by recording the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. Develop
*a Java application that will input the miles driven and gallons used (both as integers) for each trip.
*The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and print the
*combined miles per gallon obtained for all trips up to this point. All averaging calculations should
*produce floating-point results. Use class Scanner and sentinel-controlled iteration to obtain the data
*from the user.
