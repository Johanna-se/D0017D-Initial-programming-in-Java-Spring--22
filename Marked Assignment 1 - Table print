/**
*The program calculates and presents the charging time for an electric car in a table depending on different combinations of current and voltage.
* 
* pseudokod for project:
* 1. Creats variables for currents and voltage,
* 2. calculates charging powers in kW and charging time
* 3. the calculations for charging power and charging time are rounded to two decimals
* 4. Print the table
